This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns and correlations related to distance,weather, and time of day. The goal is to uncover key insights that could help in understanding accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Key Features
1. Data Analysis
Investigated the impact of weather conditions, and time of day on the occurrence of accidents.
Analyzed the frequency and severity of accidents across different weather patterns, and time intervals.

2. Pattern Identification
Identified common patterns and trends that contribute to higher accident rates, such as during adverse weather or peak traffic hours.

3. Hotspot Visualization
Mapped accident hotspots using geographical data, highlighting areas with higher accident rates.
Visualized the relationship between accident frequency and contributing factors like weather, distance, and time of day.

4.Contributing Factors
Analyzed the correlation between various contributing factors and accident severity to better understand the conditions leading to accidents.
